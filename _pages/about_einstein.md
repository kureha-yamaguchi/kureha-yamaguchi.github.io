Hi! I'm Kureha (pronounced cray.ha)- an AI Researcher at UK’s National Institute for Data Science and AI, also known as The Alan Turing Institute. I investigate AI system vulnerabilities and develop secure ML solutions within the Turing's Defence and National Security programme, working with UK Government stakeholders and academic collaborators. Prior to research, I was at the University of Cambridge completing my undergraduate and master's degrees in Information and Computer Engineering, supported by a scholarship from the Institution of Engineering and Technology. I love coding, and I really care about problem-solving in a socially responsible way that truly benefits humanity.
