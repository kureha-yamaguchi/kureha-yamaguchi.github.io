Hi! I'm Kureha (pronounced cray.ha)- an AI Researcher at UK’s National Institute for Data Science and AI, also known as <a href='https://www.turing.ac.uk/'>The Alan Turing Institute</a>. I investigate AI system vulnerabilities and develop secure ML solutions within the Turing's Defence and National Security programme, working with UK Government stakeholders and academic collaborators.

Prior to research, I was at the <a href='https://www.cam.ac.uk/'>University of Cambridge</a> completing my undergraduate and master's degrees in Information and Computer Engineering, supported by a scholarship from the Institution of Engineering and Technology.

I love coding, and I really care about problem-solving in a socially responsible way that actually benefits humanity in the long-term. Still figuring it all out and enjoying the process- thanks for visiting my page!
